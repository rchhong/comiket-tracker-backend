# Comiket Display Backend

This repository contains the backend code for the Comiket Tracker Display, written in Go.
For now, the backend is hot-reloaded using [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air), but later on, 2 Dockerfiles will be used so that hot-reloading doesn't occur.

## Set-up

```{bash}
docker compose up -d
```

## Tear-down

```{bash}
docker compose down
```
